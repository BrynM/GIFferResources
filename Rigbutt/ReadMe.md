# Rigbutt

## What is Rigbutt?

Rigbutt is a fully [Duik Bassel](https://rainboxprod.coop/en/tools/duik/) rigged character based on Dickbutt created by [K.C. Green](https://kcgreendotcom.com) in 2006. I happen to love the Dickbutt character and have been working on a fully rigged version for my fellow GIF makers to use for a long time. This is the result of that work.

## Requirements

To use this, you will need:

* After Effects 2018 or greater (v 15.x)
* [Duik Bassel](https://rainboxprod.coop/en/tools/duik/)
* Patience
* A sense of humor

If you're missing any of those turn back now until you have them. There's nothing tangible for you to use here otherwise.

## Using Rigbutt

If you open the `Rigbutt.aep` project file, you'll see some stuff in there. **But,** you're not supposed to open that. Instead **import** it into your project.
