# Python Scripts## `_all2mp4.py`#### RequirementsThis script requires a working copy of the `ffmpeg` executable someplace that can be found (sucha as your `PATH` or alongside the script) and an installed version of Python 3.#### UsageThis script can be placed alongside source files of varying formats to buld convert them to `h.264` `mp4` files. A destination directory named `mp4` will be created automatically to ensure no original source files are disturbed. Any mp4 files found in the parent source folder will be ignored.The script has a minor set of command line arguments:```C:\bryn\GIFferResources\scripts\python>python _all2mp4.py --helpusage: _all2mp4.py [-h] [-v] [-k] [-f]optional arguments:  -h, --help     show this help message and exit  -v, --verbose  debug/verbose ffmpeg  -k, --mkv      use mkv ffmpeg recipe  -f, --force    overwrite existing mp4 files foundC:\bryn\GIFferResources\scripts\python>```The formats in the parent source directory are searched for by file extension. Usable file extensions are currently `mkv`, `webm`, `avi`, and `mov`.
