# GIFferResources

Some media resources for those that make OC GIFs on sites like Imgur, Reddit, Pandawhale, Gihpy, Gifycat, and even Tumblr.

# Legal/License

Obviously, I can't put things like trademarks, copyrighted images, or other files with usage rights in here. Sorry - no Imgur logo set.

This repo will only contains stuff I create or stuff that I found to be in the public domain. 

# Who am I?

I'm BadMonkey (or sometimes badmonkey0001). I've been BadMonkey on the Internet for over 20 years now. Done lots of interesting things in that time. You can usually find me on Imgur or Reddit. So why should I make a repo like this? Well, [I've been known to make some GIFs in the last few years.](http://badmonkey0001.imgur.com/)
