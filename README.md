# GIFferResources

Some media resources for those that make OC GIFs on sites like Imgur, Reddit, Pandawhale, Gihpy, Gifycat, and even Tumblr.

# Legal/License

Obviously, I can't put things like trademarks, copyrighted images, or other files with usage rights in here. Sorry - no Imgur logo set.

This repo will only contains stuff I create or stuff that I found to be in the public domain.
