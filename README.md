# GIFferResourcesSome media resources for those that make OC GIFs on sites like Imgur, Reddit, Gihpy, Gifycat, and even Tumblr.# StructureThese resources are organized into specific categories and folders.* `3d`    * `obj` - [OBJ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) 3D model files, previews and any associated materials/textures. these can be rendered/composited with tools such as Photoshop, and After Effects with Element and can also be imported into 3D software such as Cinema 4D, Maya, Blender, or 3Ds Max.* `images`    * `maskmap` - Masks and textures used for things like UV placement    * `textures` - Some simple textures that can be applied to objects or used in creating new images* `scripts`    * `bash` - Scripts for use in a *nix environment (typically `bash`)    * `cmd` - MS Windows batch files    * `js` - Scripts for use with [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/)    * `pyton` - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) scripts# Legal/LicenseObviously, I can't put things like trademarks, copyrighted images, or other files with usage rights in here. Sorry - no Imgur logo set.This repo will only contains stuff I create or stuff that I found to be in the public domain. # Who am I?I'm BadMonkey (or sometimes badmonkey0001). I've been BadMonkey on the Internet for over 20 years now. Done lots of interesting things in that time. You can usually find me on Imgur or Reddit. So why should I make a repo like this? [Well, I've been known to make some GIFs in the last few years.](http://badmonkey0001.imgur.com/)
